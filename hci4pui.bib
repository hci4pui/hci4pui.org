	Abstract = {In this article, we reflect on the critical role of liberal arts education in fostering creative, collaborative, and ethical innovators for pervasive computing. We discuss why liberal arts education is important as a foundation for advanced studies and leadership in ubiquitous computing, and we share our experiences teaching pervasive computing in liberal arts colleges.},

@article{8628304,
	Abstract = {In this column, we ask three central questions related to ubiquitous computing education. First, why is specialized ubicomp training needed? Next, what should the goal of such specialized training be? And finally, how should these goals be accomplished pedagogically? We argue that these questions should be answered by a community that supports new forms of teaching, training, and learning in ubiquitous computing.},
